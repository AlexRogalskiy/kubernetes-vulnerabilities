    CVE:                  "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5391"
  Severity:               "high"
  Description:            "The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size."

    CVE:                  "https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5390"
  Severity:               "high"
  Description:            "Linux kernel versions 4.9+ can be forced to make very expensive calls to tcp_collapse_ofo_queue() and tcp_prune_ofo_queue() for every incoming packet which can lead to a denial of service."

  Severity:               "medium"
  Description:            "The SCTP socket buffer used by a userspace application is not accounted by the cgroups subsystem. An attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service attack. Kernel 3.10.x and 4.18.x branches are believed to be vulnerable."
